## GITHUB GOVERNANCE TEAM

The [GitHub Governance Team (GGT)](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/nmfs-st-github-governance-team/home) was established in 2023 to ensure appropriate governance for the NOAA Fisheries GitHub Enterprise Cloud. The GGT includes end-user and IT representatives from all Fiscal Management Centers (FMCs) who are using or planning on using the NOAA Fisheries GitHub Enterprise Cloud. The SEFSC end-user representative is [Lisa Ailloud](lisa.ailloud@noaa.gov) (Sarina Atkinson filling in January 2025-April 2025) and the IT representative is Shirley Kasser.
