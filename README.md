# GITHUB GOVERNANCE TEAM

The [GitHub Governance Team (GGT)](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/nmfs-st-github-governance-team/home) was established in 2023 to ensure appropriate governance for the NOAA Fisheries GitHub Enterprise Cloud. The GGT includes end-user and IT representatives from all Fiscal Management Centers (FMCs) who are using or planning on using the NOAA Fisheries GitHub Enterprise Cloud. The end-user representative for the SEFSC is Lisa Ailloud (Sarina Atkinson filling in January 2025-April 2025) and the IT representative is Shirley Kasser. See the NMFS GitHub Governance Team website (NOAA internal) for information on access to GitHub Enterprise Cloud and access to [training materials](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/nmfs-st-github-governance-team/training).
