# RESOURCES FOR SEFSC GITHUB USERS 

Welcome to the SEFSC GitHub! Here we will store living documents and information related to facilitating effective GitHub workflows at the SEFSC. 

## NEW USERS

Instructions for gaining access to the SEFSC GitHub Enterprise Organization are outlined below.

1. Review the [SEFSC Github Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)](https://github.com/SEFSC/SEFSC-Resources/blob/main/SEFSC%20GitHub%20SOP.pdf) to ensure that you understand the policies and guidelines for using the SEFSC repositories. The SOP will also instruct you on how to create a GitHub account (if not done already). 

2. Work with your supervisor on completing the [SEFSC Github User Agreement](https://github.com/SEFSC/SEFSC-Resources/blob/272ff15dd662f4b732621d4fd2c6a3b74f39cec9/SEFSC%20GitHub%20SOP%20and%20User%20Agreement%20Form/SEFSC_GitHub_User_Agreement.pdf). *Note:* The user agreement must be digitally signed (using CAC) by yourself and your supervisor. 

3. Once signed please submit a [GitHub Support ticket](https://apps-st.fisheries.noaa.gov/jirasm/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/create/317) and attach the user agreement to the ticket. Once the ticket is assigned our Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) will review and/approve the request. Once approved one of the GitHub admins will send you an invite to join the SEFSC organization which must be accepted within 7 days.

## GITHUB GOVERNANCE TEAM

The [GitHub Governance Team (GGT)](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/nmfs-st-github-governance-team/home) was established in 2023 to ensure appropriate governance for the NOAA Fisheries GitHub Enterprise Cloud. The GGT includes end-user and IT representatives from all Fiscal Management Centers (FMCs) who are using or planning on using the NOAA Fisheries GitHub Enterprise Cloud. The SEFSC end-user representative is Lisa Ailloud (lisa.ailloud@noaa.gov) (Sarina Atkinson will be filling in for Lisa Ailloud January 2025-April 2025) and the IT representative is Shirley Kasser (shirley.kasser@noaa.gov). 

Please refer to the [NMFS GitHub Governance Team website](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/nmfs-st-github-governance-team/home) for information on access to GitHub Enterprise Cloud and [training materials](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/nmfs-st-github-governance-team/training).
